				<h2>About</h2>
					<P>
						Hello and welcome to my web/online portfolio. First a little about me, I am an entry level web, software, and mobile
						application developer. I most enjoy mobile development and that is where my interest lie and hope my career takes me into
						that world. I am very ignorant when it comes to coding because I get so into solving the puzzle that I don't want to stop 
						researching, writing, and trying different ideas in order to reach the solution. I really want to get my foot in the door
						of this industy and I am hungry to become a valuable asset to a team. I will work hard, bring a good attitude, and become the strong
						developer I hope to be when given the chance. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Now this web portfolio will display my recent big project I have worked on during my time at 
						Lane Community College. The other purpose of this portfolio is to freshen up on my HTML5 and CSS3
						skills. Instead of just linking you to my project, I thought this way would be a better approach to describe
						the process of how this project was created. The project will have a link to its files where you can 
						take a look at the code itself and I will provide a link to code of this web portfolio as well. Another reason for 
						this portfolio is that this project can't be seen publically because it has to be paid for. Thank you for taking 
						your time to browse my web portfolio and I hope it gives you a better understanding of my skills. 
					</p>
