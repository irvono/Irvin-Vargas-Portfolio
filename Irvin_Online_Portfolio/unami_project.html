				<h2 id="project_name_title">Unami Web Application</h2>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						For this project I was put in a team of 3 with David, Jacob, and of course me. David mostly focused on design with implementing
						Bootstrap. This would save time getting into the details of design while getting a very elegant looking website. Jacob took the role of being a 
						tester, debugging, and programmatically making the website function correctly. I mainly specialized in implementing Identity, creating the 
						database, and conducting meetings with our client. 
					</p>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						Our client was Unami Sushi and Asian Grills who I personally appproaced about this web app. I knew they didn't have a website up
						and the only way to find their information was through their Face Book page. They gladly jumped in and I had a meeting with them where I 
						documented questions and answers so our team could begin development. Our goal was not only make them an online professional presence
						but also give our client the ability to update their website without touching any code. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>NOTE: Unami Website is not public due to it needing monthly financial support and the free trial from LCC expired</strong>
					</p>
					<h4>Languages, IDE, and other components to develop this website</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>C#</li>
							<li>Javascript</li>
							<li>Visual Studios Ultimate 2013</li>
							<li id="itemLink"><a href="https://github.com/jpbertsch/CS297N-Capstone">GitHub Click Here to view repository and download project</a></li>
							<li>ASP.NET MVC5</li>
							<li>HTML5 and Razor</li>
							<li>Microsoft Azure</li>
							<li>Bootstrap</li>
						</ul>

					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						The Home page of Unami Sushi functions like the rest of the site thanks to David with his implementation of Bootstrap. The navigation bar
						acts as an index. The four items Sushi Burrito?, Menu, About Us, and Contact Us are all part of the same page. When clicked on the page scrolls 
						automatically to that section of the page. If you look at the scroll bar on the right you can see it is positioned to where it can display the About Us 
						section of the home page in the screen capture below. Not only is the scroll bar positioned but the navigation list item is also active with a green 
						background.
					</p>
				<h3 id="project_images">
				<img src="../irvin_online_portfolio/images/unami/unami_home_about.png" alt="Unami About" width="900"/>
				</h3>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						From the next couple screen captures you can see that not only is the home page designed with that section scroll but so is 
						the menu. There are images and logos that are not properly displayed due to our deadline. If we would have kept in contact and 
						the client wanted to support the site to stay public all these final touches wouldn't be an issue. 
					</p>
				<h3 id="project_images">

				</h3>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						All these menu items you see above are all database driven so nothing is hard coded to these pages. I gathered all the information
						needed from Unami in order to build and seed the database. Not every item has an image because they never had a site and none of their 
						phsyical menus had images so these are all we had to work with. Now the next screen captures will show case all the Admin and CRUD operation
						pages that I implented with ASP.NET Identity Framework.
					</p>
				<h3 id="project_images">
				<img src="../irvin_online_portfolio/images/unami/unami_log_in.png" alt="Unami Log In" width="900"/>
				</h3>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						First we will take a look at the log in page. In order to navigate to this page you have to type in the URL. There is no way to 
						click to this page due to security reasons. As long as you have an account and are assigned the admin role you can log into
						the CRUD operation pages to update the site.
					</p>
				<h3 id="project_images">
				<img src="../irvin_online_portfolio/images/unami/unami_register.png" alt="Unami Register" width="900"/>
				</h3>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						In order to be assigned the admin role you have to register. The only way be registered is if an admin allows you that role. So what
						I did was authorized the register page under admin. Once an admin logs in they can register a new user and only they have the authorization
						to do so. As you can see these pages do not have the design as the rest of the site. We encountered a problem where when these pages were
						implemented with Bootstrap it would not display the correct information or would display an error. Our clients are young and are tech savy so
						there was no real need to make this extremely user friendly.
					</p>
				<h3 id="project_images">
				<img src="../irvin_online_portfolio/images/unami/unami_index.png" alt="Unami Master Index" width="900"/>
				</h3>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						Once the admin has logged in they are brought to this master index page. Menu Categories, Sub Categories, Menu Items, and Menu Pictures are all 
						the tables I created and seeded and here the admin can choose to edit one. The following images are self explantory. They are just the
						tables with their CRUD operation pages.
					</p>
				<h3 id="project_images">
				<img src="../irvin_online_portfolio/images/unami/unami_CRUD.png" alt="Unami CRUD" width="900"/>
				</h3>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						Here is the Menu Category Index page for CRUD operations. First is the Create New and then the list of all the current existing menu categories.
						Each category has their proper links to what operation you wish to do. Edit will allow you to update the category itself and save it accordingly.
						The details will just give you an overview of the category and its data like name and description. Delete will give yout the same view as the details
						but will ask you if you are you want to delete this?. 
					</p>
				<h3 id="project_images">
				<img src="../irvin_online_portfolio/images/unami/unami_edit.png" alt="Unami Edit" width="900"/>

				<h3 id="project_images">
				<img src="../irvin_online_portfolio/images/unami/unami_delete.png" alt="Unami Delete" width="900"/>
				</h3>
					<p id="project_paragraphs">
						These were the basic overviews of how the Unami Web App was created, developed, and how the application operated. If you have 
						Visual Studios you can download the GitHub file and view the application and its source code. The download is just what I shared
						and not the full calaborations between all my team mates. Thank you for your interest and time spent reading through this article.
